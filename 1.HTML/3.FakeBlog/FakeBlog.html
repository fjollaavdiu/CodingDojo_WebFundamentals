   <h1>NATURE LOVER</h1>
   <img src="" alt="A girl walking">

   <p>THE recent publication of volume 4, No. 1 of Nature Lover, 
       the magazine of the countryside, marks the revival of a much-needed popular journal 
       which deals with the natural history and archæology of the British countryside.
        The greatest merit of the journal is that it chooses good, 
        representative subject-matter which is fairly easily available, 
        thus bringing these rural sciences within the reach of everyman. 
        The present number contains short, readable articles on the “Unity of Nature” by C. H. Warren, 
        “Secretive Badgers” by B. M. Nicholas, “British Fritillary Butterflies” by L. H. Newman, 
        “Jimmy the Lizard” by Frances Pitt, “The Numbers of Animals” by Brian Vesey-Fitzgerald, 
        “Water Problems of Fishes” by Chapman Pincher, “Some Strange Plant Habits” by Wolseley Banks, 
        “Bird-watching on an East Coast Estuary” by R. H. Harrison, “Lavenham, Suffolk” by Geoffrey Morgan. 
        Among these authors are some of Britain's best natural history writers, 
        and some of the articles are illustrated by good photographs.</p>
